                <!--Paragraph with description of Kenneth.-->
                <p class="p1">My name is Kenneth Jay Smith, I'm 35 years old, and I currenty live in Castle Rock, Colorado. I've been living in Colorado for about 7 years now, and during the past five years of this time I have been empoyeed as a Computer Technician with South Suburban Park & Recreation District. I can definitely say that I have enjoyed working in my role as a Tech, but now I seek personal and professional growth and development. </p>
                <br>
                <p class="p2">Most recently I have begun a journey towards fullfillment of my desire to achieve professional growth and devlopment, and that is through my enrollment of a Coding Boot Camp where I'm learning to become a full stack web developer. I have found this endvour to be a very exciting, and one in which I'm looking forward to completing, so that I may start coding for myself and the District!</p>
