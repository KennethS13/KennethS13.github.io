            <!--Paragraph with description of Kenneth.-->
            <p class="p1">My name is Kenneth Jay Smith, I'm 35 years old, and I currenty live in Castle Rock, Colorado. I've been living in Colorado for about 7 years now, and during the past five years of this time I have been empoyeed as a Computer Technician with South Suburban Park & Recreation District. I can definitely say that I have enjoyed working in my role as a Tech, and that my time in this role has improved my knowledgebase and skillset in both a hardware and networking capacity. However, now I seek to aquire additional skills in my field, for both personal and professional growth and development. </p>
            <br>
            <p class="p2">So in order to achieve fullfillment of my desire for growth and devlopment, I have begun a journey towards learning to become a full stack web developer through my enrollment of a Coding Boot Camp. Although, from the very start of this process it has been extremely challenging in many ways. Some of those challenges I have already overcome, but still some I have yet to conquer. Regardless of difficulties ahead, I have found this endvour to be a very exciting, and one in which I'm looking forward to completing. In doing so I hope that I may start a new career choice in web development, coding for the District and as well as myself!</p>
