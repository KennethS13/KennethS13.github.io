                <p>My name is Kenneth Jay Smith, I'm 35 years old, and I live in Castle Rock Colorado. With in the past five years I have been working as a Computer Technician at South Suburban Park & Recreation District. I have enjoyed working in my current role as a Tech, but recently I have begun a journey towards learning to become a full stack web developer through a Coding Boot Camp. This is a very exciting path which I'm looking forward to completing so that I may start coding for myself and the District! </p>
